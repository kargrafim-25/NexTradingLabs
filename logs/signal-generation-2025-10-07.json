RSI is in neutral-to-bullish territory and MACD histogram is positive, indicating momentum supporting further upside rather than exhaustion. Bollinger Bands are widening and recent green candles printed on above-average volume, supporting a buy bias while keeping a stop below the recent 5 minute swing low to limit volatility risk.",

RSI on the 15-minute chart is neutral-to-slightly-overbought but not extreme, and MACD histogram shows rising momentum consistent with a resumption of the intraday uptrend.
